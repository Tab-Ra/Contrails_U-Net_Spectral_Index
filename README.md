# Identifying Contrails with the calculation of a spectral index and a U-Net architecture model 

Notebook(s) for the contribution to the Kaggle 'Identifying Contrails' challenge in the context of the opencampus.sh 'Intermediate Machine Learning' course during the spring semester 2023

The notebook .....ipynb contains the code <br>
The notebook combines the **U-Net** architecture implemented by the model group and the **spectral index** approach suggested by the preprocessing group. Data standardisation was adjusted accordingly.
